  <h1 id="welcome-to-firemypi">Welcome to FireMyPi!</h1>
  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p><a href="http://firemypi.org">FireMyPi</a> is a configuration tool designed to help you to configure and install the <a href="http://ipfire.org">IPFire</a> firewall on your Raspberry Pi. It eliminates the need to run the IPFire setup program and allows you to directly create a micro sd card installation of IPFire that will boot up and run on your Raspberry Pi “out of the box”.</p>
  <p>Everyone should have a firewall between their home network and the internet. You may already have a network router device that includes a built in firewall, but those are usually black boxes with limited options that are difficult to configure, maintain, and monitor. One of the great benefits of the IPFire firewall is the IPFire Web GUI which allows you to easily monitor and customize your firewall.</p>
  <p>FireMyPi with IPFire allows you to create a low cost firewall on a Raspberry Pi that “just works” without extensive configuration. You can be in control, monitor your network traffic and customize your firewall to meet your needs. For the price of a Raspberry Pi and a USB ethernet dongle FireMyPi allows you to do just that.</p>
  <p>FireMyPi configures IPFire for the Raspberry Pi without running the IPFire setup tool. FireMyPi disables the serial interface for IPFire, so no need to edit any uBoot files, and automatically identifies and configures the internal and external interfaces on the Raspberry Pi for IPFire. It also includes the basic settings that would be set with the IPFire setup program as well as advanced options that would be set with the IPFire Web GUI. This saves time for configuration and allows you to have a <strong>reviewable and reproducible</strong> configuration separate from the firewall. If your micro sd card breaks or gets corrupted, (it happens), you can just rebuild the configuration and get your firewall running again. In fact, we recommend that you create two micro sd’s with your firewall configuration so that you always have a backup ready at hand.</p>
  <p>FireMyPi was designed with the ability to configure and connect multiple separate firewall nodes with Ipsec VPN tunnels. If you need to connect multiple home networks, FireMyPi allows you to do this easily.</p>
  <h2 id="firemypi-includes-the-following-basic-settings">FireMyPi includes the following basic settings:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Turns off the serial console for the Raspberry Pi.</li>
  <li>Automatically configures the IPFire green0 and red0 interfaces on boot.</li>
  <li>Allows you to use either a USB ethernet dongle or the Raspberry Pi internal wireless nic as the red0 interface.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue with the uBoot configuration that did not allow the Rasperry Pi 4 Model B to boot correctly.</li>
  <li>Turns on file system journaling for the IPFire root file system on the micro sd card.</li>
  <li>Turns on SSH on the green0 interface for headless access to the firewall from the internal network only.</li>
  <li>Limits the IPFire Web GUI to the green0 interface for internal access only.</li>
  <li>Configures timezone, hostname, keyboard and language.</li>
  <li>Configures the root password and the Web GUI admin password.</li>
  <li>Configures and activates the DHCP server in IPFire.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="firemypi-also-includes-configuration-options-that-allow-you-to-easily">FireMyPi also includes configuration options that allow you to easily:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Configure dynamic DNS.</li>
  <li>Add additional internet DNS servers.</li>
  <li>Turn on Location Blocking.</li>
  <li>Turn on IP Address Blocklist.</li>
  <li>Configure Ipsec VPN tunnels between firewall nodes.</li>
  <li>Configure OpenVPN for remote (Road Warrior) access.</li>
  <li>Turn on the Fireinfo service.</li>
  <li>Monitor and optionally restart the red0 interface to recover from ISP network connection issues.</li>
  <li>Create a portable build that can be transferred to a remote node location.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="how-firemypi-works">How FireMyPi Works</h2>
  <p>FireMyPi is built on top of the IPFire firewall program and provides automated configuration to manage one or more firewall machines in a network. The <a href="fmp-network-diagram.png">network diagram</a> shows the key parts.</p>
  <p><img src="fmp-network-diagram.png" /></p>
  <p>The configuration information for FireMyPi consists of a set of YAML files stored in the <em>config</em> directory and in the <em>secrets</em> directory.</p>
  <p>When a build is run, FireMyPi uses the configuration files to create a <em>config</em> and <em>image</em> for the node being built.</p>
  <p>The <em>config</em> part of the build creates an overlay that is extracted onto the /var/ipfire directory and overwrites the default IPFire configuration files. The <em>config</em> creation includes a one-time run script that installs the configuration when the firewall is booted.</p>
  <p>The <em>image</em> creation step writes the <em>config</em> to an IPFire core image and installs the hooks necessary to run the configuration script. When the <em>image</em> creation step is complete, the result is a pre-configured image that can be written to a micro sd card and booted on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

  <h1 id="firemypi-quickstart-guide">FireMyPi QuickStart Guide</h1>
  <p>The <em>firemypi-walkthrough.sh</em> script automates the steps in this QuickStart Guide and produces the same single node standalone test firewall. Consider running the <em>firemypi-walkthrough.sh</em> script in lieu of or in combination with this QuickStart Guide. To run the walkthough, simply invoke the walkthrough script.</p>
  <pre id="code"><code>      ./firemypi-walkthrough.sh</code></pre>
  <p>This QuickStart Guide shows you how to configure and build a single node standalone test firewall. Use the standalone firewall configuration if your configuration will contain a single node. This is the most common configuration for a home user.</p>
  <p>The node that will be built is a test node using the default <em>prefix: firemypi</em> set in <em>config/system_vars.yml</em> and the default node number <em>1</em> which creates a firewall named <em>firemypi1test.localdomain</em> for the <em>192.168.1.0/24</em> subnet.</p>
  <p>If your home subnet isn’t <em>192.168.1.0/24</em> use a node number that matches your subnet. The default IP for this test build is <em>192.168.1.245</em>.</p>
  <p>If this IP is in use on your network, you can change it in <em>config/system_vars.yml</em> by setting <em>green_testhost:</em> to a host number that is free on your network.</p>

  <p>Note that for testing, you only need the onboard <em>green0</em> interface connected.</p>
  <p>The dongle that you will use for the external network <em>red0</em> interface should be plugged into a usb port on the Raspberry Pi, but not connected to the network. This is so that the dongle can be detected and the red0 interface properly assigned. If you have a monitor and keyboard attached to your Raspberry Pi, you can access the console directly and monitor the boot.

  <h2 id="configure-and-build-a-production-standalone-firewall">Configure and Build a Production Standalone Firewall</h2>
  <p>Once you have successfully built a test firewall, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the IPFire Web GUI. The Web GUI is where you can customize and fine tune your firewall. The <em>Logs</em> section of the Web GUI is also helpful to determine where hostile packets are coming from and see how your firewall is protecting your network.</p>
  <p>When you are ready to put your firewall in service, it’s easy to build a production firewall. Just run:</p>
  <pre id="code"><code>    ./build-firemypi.sh --node 1 --prod --image</code></pre>

  <h1 id="creating-a-build-environment-for-firemypi">Creating a Build Environment for FireMyPi</h1>
  <p>FireMyPi uses <em>ansible</em> on linux to build firewalls. If you don’t have a native linux box, here are some options to set up a build environment.</p>
  <h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
  <p>No worries, you’re good to go.</p>
  <h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
  <p>If you have a windows machine and you want to use it to build your firewall, the easiest way to do that is to install and run a linux Virtual Machine on top of windows.</p>
  <p>There are several options for a Virtual Machine supervisor so just pick one, install a linux VM and there you go.</p>
  <h2 id="mac-os">Mac OS</h2>
  <p>Ditto on the windows thing.</p>
  <h2 id="pi-on-pi-bootstrap">Pi on Pi Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>You have a Raspberry Pi that you want to use for your firewall, so why not use the same Raspberry Pi to build your firewall with FireMyPi! This is such a classic bootstrap.</p>
  <p>Install a linux distro on your Raspberry Pi and then pull down and run the FireMyPi suite. Swap micro sd cards and boot the firewall.</p>
  <p>Classic.</p>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</h2>
  <p>FireMyPi has been tested on Raspberry Pi board versions 3B+ (1G), 4B Rev 1.1 (4G) and 4B Rev 1.5. (8G). Memory usage tops out at about 500M so memory wasn’t an issue for any of these boards. FireMyPi identifies the Raspberry Pi onboard ethernet controller and assigns it to green0 based on the drivers used by the onboard nic. Currently FireMyPi will identify and assign onboard nics that use the bcmgenet, lan78xx and smsc95xx drivers. In the home environment we have not seen any issues with connection speed/throughput even when using a dongle on the USBv2 interfaces for the internet connection.</p>
  <h2 id="ethernet-dongle">Ethernet Dongle</h2>
  <p>FireMyPi identifies the ethernet dongle and assigns it to red0 based on the drivers used by the ethernet dongle. Currently FireMyPi will identify and assign dongles that use the asix, ax88179_178a, r8152, and pegasus drivers. One thing to note is that some ethernet dongles use the smsc95xx driver. Since some versions of the Raspberry Pi also use the smsc95xx driver, if your dongle uses the smsc95xx drivers, get another dongle or FireMyPi will get confused.</p>
  <p>It’s pretty easy to identify the driver that your dongle uses. Just plug the dongle into your linux system and run the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>      ip --brief address</code></pre>
  <p>The sample output below shows the list of interfaces on a Raspberry Pi 4B running Debian with three dongles plugged in:</p>
  <pre><code>      lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
      eth0             UP             x.x.x.x/xx xxxx::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/xx
      wlan0            DOWN
      eth1             DOWN
      eth2             DOWN
      eth4             DOWN</code></pre>
  <p>The interface names in the first column are what to use to identify the driver that linux assigns to the dongle. For the INTERFACE_NAME, run the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>      ls -l /sys/class/net/INTERFACE_NAME/device/driver</code></pre>
  <p>The output of the command will be a link to the driver that the dongle uses. Look at the end of the link and you will see the driver name.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples:</p>
  <p>Example with Raspberry Pi 4B running Debian with three different dongles plugged in for illustration purposes:</p>
  <pre><code>      ls -l /sys/class/net/eth0/device/driver
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Oct 19 11:17 /sys/class/net/eth0/device/driver -&gt; ../../../../bus/platform/drivers/bcmgenet

      ls -l /sys/class/net/eth1/device/driver
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec  6 14:03 /sys/class/net/eth1/device/driver -&gt; ../../../../../../../../../../../bus/usb/drivers/ax88179_178a

      ls -l /sys/class/net/eth2/device/driver
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec  6 14:04 /sys/class/net/eth2/device/driver -&gt; ../../../../../../../../../../bus/usb/drivers/r8152

      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec  6 14:32 /sys/class/net/eth3/device/driver -&gt; ../../../../../../../../../../../bus/usb/drivers/asix</code></pre>
  <p>Example with Raspberry Pi 3B+ running IPFire:</p>
  <pre><code>      ls -l /sys/class/net/green0/device/driver
      lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 /sys/class/net/green0/device/driver -&gt; ../../../../../../../../../bus/usb/drivers/lan78xx

      ls -l /sys/class/net/red0/device/driver

  <h2 id="micro-sd-card">Micro SD Card</h2>
  <p>IPFire as configured with FireMyPi takes about 2G of storage on the micro sd card so storage size isn’t really an issue for current micro sd cards. More important is the speed and durability of the micro sd card. For our test and production implementations we are using a reputable brand of U3/A2/V30 rated micro sd cards. And remember to get two so that you have a backup.</p>
  <h2 id="wireless-access-point">Wireless Access Point</h2>
  <p>We don’t enable the wireless BLUE zone on the Raspberry Pi with FireMyPi, though that can be done with the regular IPFire setup program. The reason is wireless coverage. Standalone wireless access points just have better range.</p>
  <p>When setting up the wireless access point, connect the wired home network to the LAN port on the device. This will allow the device to function as an ethernet switch between the wireless and wired portions of the home network.</p>
  <p>If you connect the wired home network to the WAN port of the device, the device will get an IP address from the firewall’s DHCP server and will still work, but the wireless network will be separate from the wired network.</p>
  <hr />
  <h1 id="configuring-firemypi">Configuring FireMyPi</h1>
  <p>FireMyPi uses YAML files to store its configuration information. These files are found in the <em>config</em> and <em>secrets</em> directory. The <em>config</em> directory contains the global configuration for FireMyPi features and specific configuration information for individual nodes.</p>
  <p>When FireMyPi runs a build, it first reads <em>config/system_vars.yml</em>. It then reads the <em>config/nodeN_vars.yml</em> file for the node being built. Additional <em>yml</em> files in the <em>config</em> and <em>secrets</em> directories are read as they are needed during the build process.</p>
  <p>Because the node configuration file is read after the system configuration. The global variables set in <em>config/system_vars.yml</em> can be overridden on a node by node basis in the node configuration files by copying the appropriate global variable from the the system configuration file to the node configuration file.</p>
  <p>YAML has some peculiarities, so when editing any of the <em>yml</em> files, do not change any of the formatting of the files. Leave the indentations and spacing as they are and keep with the same quotation marks that you find in the files.</p>
  <h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration Files</h2>
  <p>Below is a list of FireMyPi configuration files and brief description of the configuration variables that they contain. The individual configuration files have additional embedded documentation on the variables and how to set them.</p>

  <h1 id="migrating-from-ipfire-to-firemypi">Migrating from IPFire to FireMyPi</h1>
  <p>If you’re already running an IPFire firewall and want to migrate to FireMyPi, you can use <em>get-fixleases.sh</em> and <em>get-fwrules.sh</em> to copy your existing DHCP fixed leases and firewall rules into the FireMyPi build environment.</p>
  <p>When run with the ‘–ip’ argument, both of the scripts will attempt to contact and download the fixleases or firewall rules from the target firewall to the <em>config</em> directory files for the node specified. The node configuration file does not need to exist for this and can be created later to build the node.</p>
  <p>See <a href="fmp-admin-guide.html#migrating-from-ipfire-to-firemypi">FireMyPiCommands</a> for instructions on running <em>get-fixleases.sh</em> and <em>get-fwrules.sh</em>.</p>

  <p>This script takes no arguments.</p>
  <h2 id="build-firemypi.sh">build-firemypi.sh</h2>
  <p>Performs the build of FireMyPi/IPFire configurations and images. The script checks for required packages, configuration files and arguments and will exit if conditions are not met. The script runs <em>ansible-playbook</em> to build the configuration first and then if <em>–image</em> is specified will build the image. Build products are stored in the <em>deploy</em> directory along with a file that contains the parameters used for the build.</p>
  <p>Root access is required to create a loop device and mount the image file if <em>–image</em> is specified and your sudo password will be prompted for during the build.</p>
  <p>During the image build, if root access is not granted, for example if the sudo password is entered incorrectly, the image build will stop at the “Verify become root” task.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>TASK [Verify become root - this task will fail if become root fails]</p>

  <h2 id="portable-util.sh">portable-util.sh</h2>
  <p>Merges a FireMyPi portable build to an IPFire image to create a FireMyPi/IPFire image that can be booted on the Raspberry Pi. This is useful if you need to provide a configured firewall when the build facilities are not easily available.</p>
  <p>Note that portable builds are not encrypted and must be transferred securely to the remote destination.</p>
  <p>To deploy a portable image:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Build a portable image using ‘–image’ and ‘–portable’ on the build command line along with either ‘–test’ or ‘–prod’.</li>
  <li>Copy this script, the portable image tar file and an IPFire compressed image file (extension .xz) with the same core number as the build to the same directory</li>
  <li>Run the ‘./portable-util.sh’ script with the same ‘–test’ or ‘–prod’ parameter used for the build.</li>
  <li>Write the resulting image to a micro sd card and boot on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To validate compatibility, the script will confirm that the portable build tar file and IPFire image have the same core number.</p>
  <p>Sudo access is required to apply the FireMyPi portable build to an IPFire image.</p>
  <h2 id="show-build-environment.sh">show-build-environment.sh</h2>
  <p>This script shows a dashboard of either the global status of the build environment or the status of a specific node. It is very helpful for you to determine if anything is missing from your build environment and the status of any nodes that you have built or intend to build.</p>
  <p>If a node has leftover mounts from a build <em>–image</em> that failed or was interrupted, <em>show-build-environment.sh</em> will show the affected node in red on the global status dashboard and will show a warning for leftover mounts on the node status dashboard. Leftover mounts will be cleaned up automatically when a successful build is run for the affected node.</p>
  <h3 id="optional-parameters-5">Optional Parameters:</h3>
  <p><strong>–node|-n {N}</strong></p>

  <h3 id="why-dynamic-dns">Why Dynamic DNS</h3>
  <p>If you will be using Ipsec to create VPN tunnels between nodes or if you will be using OpenVPN for Road Warrior access to your network, you will need a public hostname.</p>
  <p>FireMyPi allows you to configure Dynamic DNS in order to update your DNS provider with your FireMyPi hostname.</p>
  <p>See <a href="https://www.ipfire.org/docs/configuration/services/dyndns">https://www.ipfire.org/docs/configuration/services/dyndns</a> for more information about this IPFire feature.</p>
  <p>FireMyPi implements three different authentication methods for Dynamic DNS updates. Token and Username/Password authentication are native to IPFire, HMAC-MD5 Keypair authentication, which is deprecated, is added by FireMyPi. The method that you choose will be based on the requirements of your Dynamic DNS provider.</p>
  <p>The authentication methods are:</p>
  <p><strong>token</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Authenticate with your provider using a token</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>userpass</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Authenticate with your provider with a username and password</p>

  <h2 id="organize-your-home-network">Organize Your Home Network</h2>
  <p>FireMyPi/IPFire provides a DHCP server to assign IP addresses to your network devices. Take this one step further and assign fixed leases to the devices on your network using the IPFire Web GUI. This is important because it will allow you to know what devices are recognized on your network. If a dynamic lease that you’re not expecting shows up, that could be a warning sign of an intrusion.</p>
  <p>We use the following numbering plan for our networks:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>1-99 Personal Computers / Mobile Devices / TVs / Speakers / Cameras</li>
  <li>100-199 Guest Devices / Unknown Devices</li>
  <li>200-244, 246-253 Network Switches / Wireless Access Points / Printers / Servers</li>
  <li>245 FireMyPi/IPFire Test Firewall</li>
  <li>254 FireMyPi/IPFire Firewall</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The advantage of this numbering plan is that we know that any host number under 100 is a recognized fixed host on the network. Any device with a host number in the 100’s range is either a guest or otherwise unrecognized. And any device in the 200’s range is a recognized network or server device. So it makes network host evaluation easy at a glance.</p>
  <h3 id="save-your-changes">Save Your Changes</h3>
  <p>Once you have fixed leases, use ‘get-fixleases.sh’ to download the fixleases file to your build directory so that they will be included in future builds.</p>
  <h2 id="check-the-logs">Check the Logs</h2>
  <p>One of the great features of IPFire is the <em>Logs/Fw-Loggraphs</em> tabs in the Web GUI that allow you to look at traffic blocked by your firewall by IP, Port or Country. Using these loggraphs gives you a good way to look at how your firewall is protecting your network.</p>
  <h2 id="use-location-block">Use Location Block</h2>
  <p>The Location Block feature in IPFire is an easy way to block a lot of traffic that you have no interest in seeing hit your network. It’s easy to configure the <em>block-all</em> mode with FireMyPi and allow the countries that make sense for you.</p>
  <p>Use the <em>Logs/Fw-Loggraph (Country)</em> tab in the IPFire Web GUI and you will most likely see that your firewall is getting hits from places that you would never expect.</p>
  <p>We recommend that you start with <em>block-all</em> and only allow your country at first. If this causes problems for sites that you need to access, you can incrementally allow those countries.</p>
  <p>You can fine tune the locations if needed by editing the <em>config/locationblock.yml</em> file.</p>
  <h2 id="use-ip-address-blocklists">Use IP Address Blocklists</h2>
  <p>IP Address Blocklists are lists compiled by third parties of hostile actors on the internet that are out there searching for networks that they can penetrate.</p>
  <p>So use the blocklists. Enable the <em>include_ipblocklist:</em> feature. You can fine tune the lists included by editing the <em>config/ipblocklist.yml</em> file.</p>
  <p>When we were selecting the IP Address Blocklists to include by default, we enabled all of the blocklists and selected the ones that were getting hits for our test networks. Some of the lists got zero hits in our testing, possibly due to overlap in the lists. You may want to take a similar approach for your network.</p>
  <p>Why not include all of the blocklists and leave it at that? The <em>include_blocklist:</em> feature does increase the boot time for your firewall as the blocklist rules have to be added when the firewall is started. So there is a time element that may need to be considered. But there would be no harm in enabling all of the blocklists if you want to do that.</p>
  <h2 id="block-phone-home-devices">Block “Phone Home” Devices</h2>
  <p>Devices that <em>Phone Home</em> can be of particular concern for your network for your privacy as well as for your network security. These devices may be smart TV’s, thermostats, outlets, speakers, cameras, essentially any of what are referred to as Internet of Things (IOT) devices. In one test with a smart TV on the network, we found that the smart TV was phoning home at a rate of about once per SECOND! Why does a smart TV need to be phoning home every second and what data is it sending???</p>
  <p>So, how do you block devices that are phoning home? Create a firewall rule with the IPFire Web GUI to block the device.</p>
  <p>First get the MAC address of the suspect device. You can find this in the <em>Network/DHCP Server</em> tab of the Web GUI probably in the <em>Current dynamic leases</em> section, unless you have assigned a fixed lease for the device. Once you have the MAC address, create a firewall rule to block that MAC address from accessing the internet.</p>
  <p>To create the firewall rule, go to the <em>Firewall/Firewall Rules</em> tab and click on <em>New Rule</em>. In the <em>Source</em> section, enter or paste the MAC address for the device in the <em>Source address</em> box. In the <em>Destination</em> section, click on <em>Standard Networks</em> and select <em>RED</em> for the internet. In the <em>Remark</em> box, describe the phone home device, something like ‘That evil smart TV’. Click on the <em>Log Rule</em> checkbox so that you will be able to see the effects of the rule in the logs. Click on <em>Add</em> to add the rule and then on <em>Apply Changes</em> to put the rule into effect.</p>
  <p>Once you have the phone home rule in effect, you can look at the <em>Logs/Fw-Loggraphs (IP)</em> tab to see the effects of the rule. In the case of the smart TV phone home that we tested, we saw that close to 90% of the IP address blocks by the firewall were coming from the smart TV.</p>
  <h3 id="save-your-changes-1">Save Your Changes</h3>
  <p>When you have your <em>Phone Home</em> rules in place, use <em>get-fwrules.sh</em> to pull those rules into your build environment so that they will be in place the next time you use FireMyPi to build your firewall.</p>

  <h1 id="firemypi-notes">FireMyPi Notes</h1>
  <ul>
  <li><p>FireMyPi modifies the IPFire configuration in order to build and run a customized IPFire image. As such, if the IPFire team changes the format of its configuration in the future, this may break things with FireMyPi.</p></li>
  <li><p>FireMyPi is intended to run builds as a regular user and prompts for your sudo password when needed. It is not recommended to run FireMyPi as the root user.</p></li>
  <li><p>FireMyPi config, image and portable builds are not encrypted. Use care and secure or encrypted transport methods when transferring any of these build products as they contain the secrets that you have created for your builds.</p></li>
  <li><p>By default, FireMyPi uses <em>254</em> as the host number for the firewall and <em>245</em> as the host number for the test firewall. We use these host numbers because <em>254</em> puts the firewall at the top endpoint of the subnet address range and <em>245</em> is easy to remember for the test firewall as a companion to the production firewall. These host numbers are set in <em>config/system_vars.yml</em> so that they can be changed if your needs differ.</p></li>
  <li><p>If a build is interrupted during the create image step, the mounts of the image file may not be removed. If this happens, you will see warnings in the <em>show-environment.sh</em> dashboard. The mounts will be cleaned up the next time you build an image. The warnings are there as a reminder to not &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; out of the build process.</p></li>
  <li><p>IPFire core images 182 and 183 have a problem with the dhcpcd daemon (version 10.0.4) staying running after initially getting an IP address from the ISP. The dhcpcd problem is apparently more likely to occur on aarch64 devices such as the Raspberry Pi. As a result, after the initial lease time, the firewall loses connectivity to the internet. This can be fixed with a reboot, manual restart of the red0 interface or using the <em>include_monitor_red0:</em> feature with the <em>monitor_red0_restart:</em> option. This bug has been fixed in dhcpcd (version 10.0.6) included in core image 184.</p></li>
  <li><p>IPFire uses a self-signed certificate. You will need to accept the self-signed certificate in order to access the Web GUI.</p></li>
  <li><p>When using <em>include_ipblocklist:</em> with FireMyPi, it will take a while for the public IP Address Blocklists to be downloaded after the first boot. If you are monitoring the Raspberry Pi console during the boot, you will see a delay and error messages during the firewall start as IPFire attempts to load the blocklists that are not yet downloaded. When the boot is completed, FireMyPi will start a script to monitor for the blocklist downloads and reload the firewall when the downloads have completed. As a result, on a first boot, you will not start to see packets blocked in the IP Address Blocklist Logs for about 20 minutes. The IP Address Blocklists included by default in <em>config/ipblocklist.yml</em> are those that we’ve found to have the most drops in our testing. The IPFire Web GUI <em>Firewall/IP Address Blocklists</em> tab has links to the blocklist providers where you can get information about the individual blocklists.</p></li>
  <li><p>When using <em>include_ovpn:</em>, FireMyPi will create the necessary Certificate Authority (CA) and Host Certificates for the node. These are stored in the <em>secrets/ovpn</em> directory. The certificates are created once and reused on subsequent builds of the same node. This means that when a node is rebuilt the certificate used for Road Warrior remote admin access will stay the same and not need to be updated on mobile devices where it has been previously installed.</p></li>
  <li><p>FireMyPi is built with a combination of shell scripts and ansible playbooks. Everything that FireMyPi does is available in clear text for your inspection.</p></li>
  <li><p>FireMyPi sets the same root and Web GUI admin passwords for all nodes that it builds. If you want different passwords for different nodes, you can change the passwords on a running node with ‘passwd root’ and/or ‘htpasswd /var/ipfire/auth/users admin’ from the command line.</p></li>
