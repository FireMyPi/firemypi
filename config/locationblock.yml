# FireMyPi:  locationblock.yml
#

# Set the locationblock mode and the countries for the firewall to
# block or allow here.
#
#   These are global settings for all nodes.
#

#
# The locationblock_mode determines the default behavior of locationblock.
# The idea behind this is that you typically want to block all locations
# and only allow a select few or allow all locations and only block a select
# few.
#
#     locationblock_mode: (allow-all | block-all)
#
# If allow-all, all locations will be allowed except for the countries
# specified in the locations list below.
#
# If block-all, all locations will be blocked except for the countries
# specified in the locations list below.
#

#   locationblock_mode: "allow-all"
    locationblock_mode: "block-all"

# Locations listed here will be allowed if mode is block-all and blocked
# if mode is allow-all.

    locations:

    - country: "US"
#    - country: "GB"
#    - country: "FR"
#    - country: "CN"
